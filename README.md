### questions

* You have to train a 10 gb model on a 8gb RAM machine - Imagine you have a neural net and a SVM, which different techniques would you use for batching?

* How would you approach cross-validation for time series data?

* Can you use k-fold cross validation for time series data?

* How does a recurrent neural net work? 

* Why is lightGBM only used with more than 10,000 data points?
